# Welcome to MagicTitle3 repository

## Overview
This project is a simplified Unity implementation of **Magic Tiles 3**. 

## Gameplay
### Rhythmic Tile Generation & Movement
* Tiles should be generated and fall downwards rhythmically, synchronized with a background music track.

### Player Input & Scoring
* Allow the player to tap/click on the falling tiles to score points. Successfully tapped tiles should disappear
* Implement a scoring system that awards points based on the timing accuracy of the player's taps (e.g., higher points for perfect taps on the beat). Define clear windows for "Perfect," "Good," and "Miss.

### Game Over Condition
* Implement a basic "Game Over" state when a tile reaches the bottom of the screen without being tapped.

### Visual & Audio Feedback
* Implement a visual feedback system (e.g., particle effects, animations) and/or an audio feedback system (e.g., sound effects) for successful tile taps and misses.
  
### Dynamic Background
* Enhance the game with a visually appealing and dynamic background.
  
### Combo System
* Implement a basic combo system where consecutive successful taps increase the score multiplier.
